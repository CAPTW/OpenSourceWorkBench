# Decision Log

This log records architecture and process decisions that shape OSW v0.1.
Decisions are append-only unless a later ADR explicitly supersedes one.

## ADR-0001: Local-First Git Safety

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: OSW work is performed by Codex in local repositories and worktrees.
  Review, amend, and recovery prompts must not risk remote state or user work.
- Decision: Codex workflows must not push, force-push, add or modify remotes,
  delete branches, delete worktrees, run `git reset --hard`, or run `git clean`
  unless a user explicitly requests the exact operation.
- Consequences: More local reports and checkpoint commits are required, but
  recovery is easier and remote repository state remains user-controlled.

## ADR-0002: Use `src/osw` Package Layout

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: OSW needs a standard Python layout that keeps package imports
  explicit and separates product code from tests, docs, tools, and examples.
- Decision: The Python package lives under `src/osw`. Tests import the package
  through normal packaging or the configured local test environment.
- Consequences: Packaging metadata must include the `src` layout, and examples
  should not depend on implicit current-directory imports.

## ADR-0003: Heavy Dependencies Are Optional Extras

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: v0.1 targets PySide6, meshio, Gmsh, PyVista, Matplotlib, CalculiX,
  OpenFOAM templates, Cantera, CoolProp, and MATLAB/Octave workflows, but not
  every developer or CI job should install heavy stacks.
- Decision: Heavy GUI, mesh, solver, CFD, chemistry, thermophysical, and
  visualization dependencies remain optional extras. The base install supports
  import, CLI smoke checks, and lightweight tests.
- Consequences: Feature code must guard optional imports and report missing
  extras clearly. Unit tests cannot assume heavy extras are installed.

## ADR-0004: No GUI Direct Solver Subprocess Execution in v0.1

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: GUI-triggered external solver execution increases safety,
  reproducibility, cancellation, and environment complexity.
- Decision: v0.1 GUI workflows may prepare, preview, validate, and inspect
  solver cases, but must not directly launch external solver subprocesses.
- Consequences: Solver demos should use prepared templates, dry-run case
  generation, imported results, and clear command-line handoff documentation.

## ADR-0005: Worktree, Checkpoint, and Amend Loop

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: Review and amend work can damage a useful implementation if done
  directly on the only working copy.
- Decision: Phase-step work uses `feature/osw-*` worktrees from `develop`.
  Review starts from a checkpoint commit. Risky review fixes use
  `amend/osw-*` branches or worktrees from the checkpoint.
- Consequences: Branch history may contain local checkpoint commits, but merge
  to `develop` remains clean through squash commits after gate approval.

## ADR-0006: Review-Gated Squash Merge and Release Evidence

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: OSW needs traceable quality gates without depending on remote CI or
  industrial certification claims.
- Decision: Merge to `develop` requires review score thresholds, clean source
  and target worktrees, QA evidence, artifact checks, and a squash commit. A
  release candidate requires a separate release gate with validation, docs,
  packaging, and claim checks.
- Consequences: Some changes wait for documentation and QA evidence before
  merge, but `develop` remains understandable and release claims stay bounded.

## ADR-0007: Local Harness Scripts Are Advisory Until Wired

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Context: OSW needs local QA commands before remote CI or connector automation
  exists.
- Decision: Harness scripts under `tools/qa/` and hook entrypoints under
  `tools/hooks/` are tracked, local-first, and safe to run without network
  access. They report missing optional tools explicitly.
- Consequences: The harness can gate local work immediately while remaining
  lightweight. Future CI may call the same scripts.
